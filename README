This is a demonstration of a simple web gallery.

Setup:

mkdir images thumbs
<copy your images into the images directory>
python3 resize.py  # will shrink all images and put them to thumbs
python3 server.py  # starts a flask server

The gallery should be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/show. It should be
possible to add a new image to images/ directory and it should be automatically
resized and will show up in the gallery (after a refresh).
